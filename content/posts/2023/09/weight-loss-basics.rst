:summary: Lifestyle changes and principles of healthy eating


We live in an information age with access to gyms anywhere.  There truly are
not many good remaining reasons for being overweight or at an extremely
unhealthy body weight.
Some of those reasons might be legitimate health conditions (such as
hypothyroidism, severe diabetes, or metabolic disorder).
But for the majority of people, physical health is something you have an equal
ability and responsibility over as your emotional and psychological health.

I don't think it's having too high of expectations for ourselves.
A lot of times I look to disabled people for inspiration, I feel that if this
person is able to have such a positive attitude and healthy spiritual attitude
despite having disadvantages, depending on others more than they'd like to, all
these things... then why should someone with nothing serious to complain about
be entitled to any less ambitious, respectful, and positive of an attitude?
Why should they be allowed to be any less of the person?
