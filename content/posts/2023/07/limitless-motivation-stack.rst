We'll focus on two angles: dopamine and mitochondria.

Dopamine is a transmitter in the brain which controls motivation and physically
completing tasks, planning, concentrating, as well as many other things.

Mitochondria are the "powerhouses" of our cells. But they are also fragile.
Any cellular processes that need to be carried out depend on the mitochondrial
networks.
