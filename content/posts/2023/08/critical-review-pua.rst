The piece also complains that Mystery goes up to too many women or somehow
isn't selective enough about the ones he tries to start conversations with.

What these critics fail to realize is that they and society at large are
engaging in an extremely similar behavior with widely used dating apps like
Tinder, which often involve the same practice of swiping large numbers of
people blindly.
[But then these same critics will use a dating app like Tinder ]

And while it's true we may occasionally throw in a super like with a
personalized, preemptive message â€” there's no denying a fair number of
our matches and encounters depend on mass swiping sessions.

This is something which occurs in sales too, with most people being unwilling
to entertain a cold call or sales pitch. But this analogy breaks down because
in dating one shouldn't be trying to sell themselves or anything, not even a
better life.
But interestingly the percentages seem similar. Roughly 1% of interactions will
end with a sold product or lasting connection.
And with dating life, things do not have to be so calculated or results-driven.
It's important to have fun with it, to enjoy the other person and whatever
happens.

The idea that talking to people in person is cold & calculated is itself
cynical. Conventional opinion today holds that dating apps are acceptable, but
these apps typically involve a similar or even greater degree of impersonal
screening. I can see no reason for preferring one means over the other.

I can even think of many negatives associated with online dating.

The opinion than pick up artists are inherently bad people is itself pejorative
and a deeply rooted prejudice, a kind of hypocrisy and almost mass psychosis.

==> But it's random?

So are chance encounters at the bar or through friends, or online dating apps.

I will not be flustered in my unwavering defense.
