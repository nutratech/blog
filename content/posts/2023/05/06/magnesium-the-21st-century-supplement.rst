It's said magnesium is involved in over 300 functions and enzymes within the
body. And nearly two-thirds of Americans are mildly deficient (with nearly
10% estimated to suffer from more moderate deficiency).

But what are some of these functions within the body, aren't people getting
enough from their diet, what are the potential risks of a mild deficiency, who
should be considering supplementation and what amounts are considered safe?


The background
#######################################################

Magnesium is considered a macro-mineral as opposed to a *trace* mineral, which
means the body requires it in large amounts. Potassium is another good example,
its daily requirement can be measured in grams, as a powder supplement you
would need to take it by the teaspoonful.

In farming, a proper balance of magnesium and calcium is essential, and one's
diet should in theory provide adequate intake. And this was likely often the
case with paleolithic man. But in today's age, diluted by the empty calories
of fast food and convenience, it is far less certain these requirements will
be consistently met.


The organ systems
#######################################################

As a enzyme co-factor and electrolyte, magnesium is essential to every system
but its role in heart, muscle and nerve function are among the most noteworthy.

As a supplement it is often prescribed in conjunction with other treatments, to
aid with muscle fatigue & leg cramps, sleep, anxiety, and heart palpitations.

Threonate is the best form of magnesium.
