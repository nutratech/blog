Karl Jung spoke frequently of a "mass psychosis", and J. A. Schmit once said,
"... the truth is that a stupidity, even after having passed through a million
mouths, does not become less foolish."

Like my heroes, I'm here to make the bold, scientific claim that a cheaper,
simpler, safer supplement actually also produces superior results.

Oftentimes people are reluctant to adopt a simple solution. They wish to hit a
fly with a hammer. They wish to pay more or use a product with elevated status,
treating supplements almost as a "Veblen good", as if they were fancy cars.

Melatonin is an end product in the body, a highly metabolized form of serotonin
(5-HT).

Further, users of melatonin (across various dosage levels) consistently report
feeling strange in the morning, and not any more well rested or alert.

Dizziness, trace, paradoxically sleepy.


Addendum: 5-HTP

It's too potent, again. It's not found in nature, except small amounts in one
obscure bean plant. It's associated (even if weakly) with fibrosis of the heart
valves.

Subjectively, it promotes sociability and good mood. It has a more potent
effect that L-Tryptophan, and can be experimented with on occasion. But it
probably shouldn't be used on a daily basis without doctor's approval.

Most of the supplements I recommend are "boring", they are found already in our
diet (just not always in adequate amounts), they are safe and well-tolerated
(in 98%+ of people).
