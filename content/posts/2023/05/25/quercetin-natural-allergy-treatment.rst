This time of year many of us will be reaching for allergy relief medicines, but
these often have side effects and lose efficiency over time.
For many of us, there may be a better option.

Chicken Soup
####################################################

Commonly recommended to ease symptoms of the common cold, chicken soup is
thought to provide relief through a mild immune-suppressive action.

The parsley and onion in soup are good sources of quercetin, a bio-flavonoid
and "mast cell stabilizer". By moderating the activity of special types of
white blood cells, quercetin has shown promise in a variety of auto-immune
diseases.
Although generally healthy, and even promoting immune function where needed,
edge cases deserve special consideration with a health care professional.
Quercetin has shown anti-viral properties as well, but is not clear how this
would work in the case for example of an HIV patient.

By slightly reducing the aggressiveness of the immune response, chicken soup
is able to bring about a moderate reduction in mucus production, sneezing and
other irritating symptoms without slowing down the body's clearance of the
virus.
