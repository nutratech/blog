INGREDIENTS
###########

- 1 cup dry soy beans (heaping cup)
- Filtered or spring water


DIRECTIONS
##########

Soak beans overnight (6-18+ hours) in a quart jar with Â½ tsp of salt.

Drain jar into a strainer and rinse beans off in tap water.

Parboil beans in 6 cups of water on medium for 8-10 minutes.

Strain, rinse, and add beans to the blender. Add enough water to blend (keep a
running total of how much water you added, you will need to add 11 cups total).

Wash stock pot out.

Blend on high for 15-20 seconds. Dump blended beans into the stock pot. Add the
remaining water (11 cups in total).
Slowly bring to a boil, and reduce to a simmer for 10 minutes.

Let cool and settle.

Decant the beans into a 400 micron hop filter or nut milk bag. LEAVE the thick
portion (sludge) for a second filtration.
Whisk, shake, or squeeze until everything is reclaimed.

Pour the remaining sludge into the filter and work it though.

Repeat above steps for the 50 micron filter. At this filtration level you can
then shake the soy milk before each use, and it will not cause any chalkiness
on the palate.

Refrigerate in a storage container.
