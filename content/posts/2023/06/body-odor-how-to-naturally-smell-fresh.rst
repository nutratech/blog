How to get away with taking a shower less often. LESS often. Not altogether.
That'd be gross.

But you can skip a day or two here and there with some of these tricks.
And maybe you'll fool everyone, including yourself, and avoid that smell,
that icky, sticky feeling from head to toe.


Tips
####

Wear breathable clothes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Avoid hot drinks and vigorous exercise in the summer.
Know your limits and change your clothes often (particularly undershirts,
socks, and other close-fitting undergarments).


Use charcoal or peppermint soap
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use a special soap to remove extra bacteria and smell.

Scrub your pits well. Don't let the stench set in.


Use crystal deodorant
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Even though it's natural, it still has aluminum salts,
which absorb (but not very well) through the skin.


Get a bidet
~~~~~~~~~~~

Bidets don't **replace** toilet paper. You still must remove the heavy
stuff before spraying it down.
Consider this an added layer of security.
It gets material and bacteria out of the way, which would otherwise be left
smeared behind.


70% alcohol wipes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Get the full-size ones, not the thin/tiny lens cleaners, and not prep pads.

You can freshen up your pits and *derriere* between showers, after the gym,
before changing undershirts, or before a party (if you're time-pressed or don't
have shower access).

Alcohol wipes are a great cheat code.


Keep your furniture and bedding clean
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Don't take a shower just to crawl into a dirty bed, and don't law on your
clean couch when you're overdue for a shower.


Epsom Salt Foot Bath
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An Epsom salt bath can help freshen up the feet, removing lint, exfoliating,
and leaving them feeling fresh and reinvigorated.
