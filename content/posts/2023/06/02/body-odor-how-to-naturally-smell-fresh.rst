How to get away with taking a shower less often. LESS often. Not altogether.
That'd be gross.

But you can skip a day or two here and there with some of these tricks.
And maybe you'll fool everyone, including yourself, and avoid that smell,
that icky, sticky feeling from head to toe.

Tips
####

Wear breathable clothes.
Avoid hot drinks and vigorous exercise in the summer.

Scrub your pits well. Don't let the stench set in.

Use crystal deodorant. Even though it's natural, it still has aluminum salts,
which absorbed but not very well through the skin.

Get a bidet.
This isn't a replacement for toilet paper, you still need to get the heavy
stuff out of the way before spraying down.
Consider this an added layer of security.
It gets material and bacteria out of the way, which would normally be smeared.
