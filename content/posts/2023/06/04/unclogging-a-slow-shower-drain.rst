When a shower starts to drain slowly, when you find yourself up to your ankles
in water it may be time to perform an intervention on the clogged drain.

Plunger

Flood with warm/hot water and plunge hard for several iterations

You may need to repeat this process a few times.

You can start with boiling water to loosen the gunk.
