:summary: A review of evidence for royal jelly in skin products and my personal
          anecdotes.


I frequently recommend an organic grape seed oil for use on my clients' faces
and sensitive skin (especially after a shower, during those dry months, or as
part of a daily moisturizing routine).

There are plenty of other products and natural compounds on the market that
claim to enhance skin appearance or even to be "anti-aging", so what makes
royal jelly special? What is royal jelly even?

**TODO:** Complete this.
