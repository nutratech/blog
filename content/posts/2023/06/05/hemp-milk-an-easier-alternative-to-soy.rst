          by itself.


Hemp milk is much easier to make than soy, but also does not pack the same
protein punch.


INGREDIENTS
###########

- 1 cup hulled hemp seeds (heaping cup)
- Filtered water


EQUIPMENT
#########

- Filters 400 micron & 50 micron (or nut milk bag)
- Blender
- Measuring cup (or scale)
- Storage device (glass pitcher)


DIRECTIONS
##########

Add the heaping cup of hemp seeds to a blender with 2-4 cups of water or what
comfortably fits in your blender.

Blend on high for 1 minute.

Let the foam settle for a minute or two.

Pour through the filters or nut milk bag.

Refrigerate.
