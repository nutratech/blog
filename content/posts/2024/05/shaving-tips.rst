Aloe
####

Applying an aloe gel-based lotion prior to shaving dramatically reduces the
rate of chaffing and facial dandruff.

It greatly reduces redness and irritation after an electric or manual razor.

It forms a protective layer, locking skin in and keeping the metal blades out.



Quality Electric Razor (Or clippers)
####################################

I often use clippers (going for a 5 o'clock shadow, or recently shaved look).

If you use a manual razor, consider trying a few premium models of electric
razors.
They provide a convenient experience, are often water-friendly, and can do
a similar job in less time.

They can also be used to touch up around the neck and result in less irritation
than manual razor blades.



Shower
######

It helps to shower before and after.  If you don't have time, you can always
use a warm compress to soften your facial hairs.

A similar practice can be applied to the legs, softer hairs are easier to cut.



Horse hair brush (for dry shavers)
##################################

Used for cleaning your hands, arms, shoulders, face, and neck of stray hairs.



Stay on top of shaving, but don't overdo it
###########################################

Depending on your job, you may have to shave more often than others.  But it is
better to limit it to 3 or 4 times per week.

Conversely, you don't want to go more than five or six days, because then you
get into clipper territory (razor blades are less effective on long hair).
