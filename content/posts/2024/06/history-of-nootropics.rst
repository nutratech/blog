**NOTE:** Draft, work in progress!

Nootropics, or "brain enhancers," have a long history of use over the millennia, and many "stacks" or recommendations have emerged systematically from a body of modern evidence.

In India, Bacopa's use (aka Brahmi) dates back nearly as far as writing.  Vedic scholars of ancient India have been known to consume "Medhya Rasayana" (a mixture containing gotu kola and Bacopa) that helped them memorize lengthy scriptures 3,000 years ago.

In China, the use of Lion's Mane started about 3000 BCE.  Although Lion's Mane was prescribed for immune or gastrointestinal health, there is some evidence it was used as a neural tonic, memory aid, longevity agent, and to promote general mental health or vigor.

By the 1st millennium BCE, the use of Lion's Mane had spread as far as the Yamabushi monks of Japan, who lived in the mountains and are widely regarded as having popularized its use in meditation (as a focus aid and to heighten awareness).

For comparison, the first recorded instance of a tea ceremony comes 1900 years later, around the 9th century CE.  Although tea is today regarded as an effective nootropic (owing to its caffeine, theanine, and catechin content), it was not always associated with mental clarity.  This development highlights the divergence of modern medicine — or a theory-based approach — from Ayurveda — which depends exclusively on experience and experimentation.



Monoaminergic Nootropics
########################

These nootropics work directly — by altering or enhancing neurotransmitter function — leading to direct effects and downstream benefits and changes.


Cholinergics
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Choline:** Piracetam, choline, ALCAR; Nicotine
- **Dopamine:** Selegiline, Amphetamine
- **Glutamate:** Ginkgo, NAC, Ketamine (low dose)



Neurotrophic Nootropics
#######################

These nootropics work by improving neurotrophin synthesis and cell survival and function.

- **NGF:** Lion's mane
- **BDNF:** Many, including turmeric, astragalus, gotu kola, fish oil, antidepressants, exercise, CBD/THC
- **GDNF:** Naringin; Selegiline
