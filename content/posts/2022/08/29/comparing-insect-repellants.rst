:summary: A head-to-head comparison of top insect repellents.


DEET
#######################################################

.. note::

    DEET damages synthetic clothing and many types of plastics & composites.

The original insect deterrent. Does not so much "repel" mosquitoes and ticks as
it does confuse them and "disable" the biting behavior. They will still land,
but if properly applied, not bite.

This one is completely synthetic, made in a lab. But nothing very bad can be
said about it, other than applying it regularly to your face is probably not
advised.

I do not use this as much as the others on this list. But if I need to seal off
a window or enforce a perimeter, I will spray down equipment or relevant areas.
I will use it on cotton clothing (e.g. thin T-shirts), and occasionally on
exposed skin (legs, feet, arms, shoulders).


Lemon Eucalyptus Oil
#######################################################


Picaridin
#######################################################

Effective, long-lasting (~12 hours), available as a pump spray, semi-natural,
non-irritating (except to the eyes & mouth), affordable, safe on clothing and
my personal favorite.

Slightly oily residue.


IR3535
#######################################################

As effective as the others, without lasting as long (~8 hours).

Only a few brands available, comes in an aerosol spray (must be used before
it loses pressure).

Must be used outside in a well-ventilated area; causes vigorous respiratory
irritation.
