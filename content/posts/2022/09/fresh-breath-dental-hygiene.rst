Electric toothbrush
###################

Using an electric toothbrush can remove additional plaque and stains, keeping
your teeth healthy and white.

Don't brush *immediately* after a meal, this can damage enamel.
Wait a few minutes for food to loosen, swish with alkaline drops, and floss
first.


Frequent dentist visits
#######################

Better to diagnose problems early and obtain frequent plaque cleanings and
polishes.


Tongue cleaner
##############

The tongue is a rough surface where bacteria and food debris readily
accumulate. It's also where the scent of smoked marijuana lingers.

By using a good stainless steel tongue cleaner between meals, you can greatly
freshen your breath and cut down on bacteria in your mouth.

I recommend a couple different tongue cleaners. One for each bathroom, or for
traveling. A long one, one which scrapes sharply. A plastic one for delicate
work.

Find a set of tongue cleaners which suite your needs.


Gum serum / remineralization powder
###################################

Use this after acidic or sugary meals, or if you cannot access a toothbrush.

Use this throughout the day (together with a tongue cleaner) to maintain fresh
breath and a neutral pH.

It does not actually remineralize as well as fluoride, but it is still a great
way to keep bacteria in check (if you can't brush, or clean your tongue).
This will help keep your breath fresher, and improve your taste of food.


Floss
#####

Ideally bamboo or coconut.

If you are going to skip brushing, floss between meals and snacks.
In addition to the remineralizing drops, it is a great alternative to constant
brushing.


Multiple toothpastes
####################

- Clay-based (e.g. Uncle Harry's)
- Fluoridated
- Charcoal

Have at least one portable toothpaste as well, for on the go.  As well as the
remineralizing drops


Vodka brushing (optional)
#########################

Particularly relevant if you consume Cannabis, as the oils will condense on
your teeth and stain them brownish.

Brush with 1/4 of a shot of vodka for 1 minute, once or twice a week.

This can also aid to remove non-polar food stains, where other methods have
failed.


Diet
####

Less processed sugars, sweet fruits; more spicy food and savory vegetables.

Some raw foods and less processed foods overall, to promote healthy gut
bacteria.

Supplements
~~~~~~~~~~~

Depending your diet, you may want to supplement calcium citrate. And a
magnesium source.

Take 1/2 multivitamin on days where you eat less healthy, as some of the
vitamins are involved in maintaining internal tooth health.

Other tips
~~~~~~~~~~

Spring or filter water with a pH above 7. Limit soda, citrus, other acidic
drinks.

Stay hydrated, avoid dry mouth and breath through nose if possible.

Limit snacking. Brush between meals.

Don't clench, grind or bite your lip or fingers. Don't cause obvious damage.
