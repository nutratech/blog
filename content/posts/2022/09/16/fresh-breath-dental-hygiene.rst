Electric toothbrush
###################

Using an electric toothbrush can remove additional plaque and stains, keeping
your teeth healthy and white.

Brush as needed, 3 times or more a day.
Rinse with tap water when not using fluoride toothpaste.
Only order "rounded" bristles, as these will not damage you enamel as much.

Don't brush *immediately* after a meal, this can damage enamel.
Wait a few minutes for food to loosen, swish with alkaline drops, and floss
first.


Frequent dentist visits
#######################

Better to diagnose problems early and obtain frequent plaque cleanings and
polishes.


Tongue cleaner
##############

The tongue is a rough surface where bacteria and food debris readily
accumulate. It's also where the scent of smoked marijuana lingers.

By using a good stainless steel tongue cleaner between meals, you can greatly
freshen your breath and cut down on bacteria in your mouth.

I recommend a couple different tongue cleaners. One for each bathroom, or for
traveling. A long one, one which scrapes closer. A plastic one if you prefer.

Find a set of tongue cleaners which suite your needs.


Gum serum / remineralization powder
###################################

Use this after acidic or sugary meals, or if you cannot access a toothbrush.


Floss
#####

Ideally bamboo or coconut, with charcoal.

If you are going to skip brushing, use this between meals and snacks.


Multiple toothpastes
####################

- Clay-based (e.g. Uncle Harry's)
- Fluoridated
- Charcoal

Have at least one portable toothpaste as well, for on the go.


Diet
####

Less processed sugars, fruits; more spicy food and savory vegetables.

Some raw foods, and no processed foods overall. To promote healthy gut
bacteria.

Supplement calcium. And magnesium.

Take 1/2 multivitamin on days where you eat less healthy, as some of the
vitamins are involved in maintaining internal tooth health.

Spring or filter water with a pH above 7. Limit soda, citrus, other acidic
drinks.

Stay hydrated, avoid dry mouth and breath through nose if possible.

Limit snacking. Brush between meals.
